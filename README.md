# wineQuality
 
 This is a program which predicts wine quality based on its physicochemical features. The wines are all specific to the Vinho Verde region of Portugal, and have been given a score from wine experts. Red wine scores range between 3-8, and white wine scores range from 3-9. The output classes are imbalanced, with the large majority of wines for both red & white being either 5 or 6. 

 Dataset came from UC Irvine's Machine Learning Repository.
